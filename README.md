Hey! I'm Harry, right now I'm a Communications Assistant at the Yee Hong Foundation and a regular old Computer Science student with AEO to the HBA program at Western. 

But, I've got big dreams of becoming so much more. Graphic design is my passion and for a while, I've been using the medium as a way to drive change at school, in my community and at other companies and organizations. 

Throughout high school I've led several councils and organizations, from the Athletic Council to CREATE Markham I love to put myself out there and am seeking opportunities in London where I can leverage my experience and skills in design to drive positive change within our community!
